```css
hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
```

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: 
- **hue**: 0-360
- **saturation**: 0-100%
- **lightness**: 0-100%

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue ***red is at 0 degrees***, ***green is at 120 degrees***, and ***blue is at 240 degrees***.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color. You must add the percent sign `%` to the saturation and lightness values.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.
