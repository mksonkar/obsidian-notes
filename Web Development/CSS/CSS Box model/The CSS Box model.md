In the CSS box model, 
- every HTML element is treated as a box, 
- with four areas.

Imagine an Flipkart package you received. The content is the item in the box.
(In our case, it can be a  heading, paragraph, or image.)

The content is surrounded by space called **padding**. Similar to how bubble wrap separates the item from the box.

The **border** is the box that the package came in.

**Margin** is the area outside of the box, 
It can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.

In box model, margin collapses. 
This means that if two boxes are adjacent to each other. Margins will overlap and the larger margin will be effective.
