Hooks are functions, introduced in React 16.9

Hooks are functions that let you hook into React state, and lifecycle features from components.

`useState` hook is the most commonly used hook in React.
- `useState` hook should be called at the top level of the component.

Hooks have two main benefits: 
- Readability 
- Usability

- You can only call hooks at the top level of your components (or your own hooks)
- You cannot call hooks inside loops or conditions.
- You can only call hooks from React functions, and not regular JavaScript functions.
