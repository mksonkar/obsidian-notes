Component based architecture
Reusable code
React is declarative


Roadmap
1. understanding DOM
jQuery was used to write dynamic websites. 
then React and Vue came into the picture.
Try to make dynamic websites using raw JS.
learn to Manipulate DOM
this will make you understand why u need react.

2. understanding reconciliation & how React works under the hood.
3. React as a wrapper.
    todo, calculator. sudoku, basic apps.
4. Components, state, rendering and props.
5. Hooks. 
	  lifecycle methods, 
	  use, 
	  benifit,
	  useCallback, useMemo, (all 5)
6. Custom hooks.
7. prop drilling, context API, & suspense API 
     state management,
     redux etc.
8. state management tools
9. routing.
		how to handle multiple pages.
     react is a single page application
     libraries for routing.
10. styling
     css libraries: tailwind, material UI, (get comfotable with at least one)
11. Tooling behind bootstraping a react app (good to know, for interview)
    babel, vite, how it replaced create-react-app, etc
12. performance
		react hook forms , formik
		swr, react-query
